		<h2 id="VG">Video Games</h2>
		<p>Video games are a fun way to spend your spare time. You can interact with your friends, other online people, or go on
			a solo adventure. I personaly love games such as rust, minecraft, league of legeneds, and civilization 6. These games
			use a lot of skill, smarts, and spamming.</p>
		<h2 id="GS">Getting Started</h2>
		<p>First of all you need a pc or laptop, then download steam and epic games . Steam is one of the most popular computer
			gaming platforms and epic games </p>
